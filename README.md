# Awesome phones

## What is this?
You can see how a React app works with a custom API & MongoDB for data permanence.


## How to run the app
### First step
You need a back to run the app. For this, you can visit this [repo](https://github.com/ElenaMLopez/awesome-phones-api) and clone it. There you can find a piece of complete information about how to run this back, it is quite easy if you have docker ^.^

After seeing the message `awesome-phones-api_mongo-seed_1 exited with code 0` in the console, (don't worry this is normal), you are able to run the front.

### Second step
After cloning this repository you have two options:
1. You have docker installed (recommended), just type in the console:
#### `docker-compose up`
This will run the app and you can visit the `localhost://8080` and see the results.

2. You prefer to run the app with Node.js. Open the folder in the console and run the 
#### `yarn install or `npm install`
After this, you can run:
#### `yarn start` or `npm run`

## How to test the app 

You can test the app by running the following commands:
1. React-testing-library : **yarn test**
2. E2E test with cypress: **yarn cypress**

# React info:

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
